// [HIGH] Help -> About viv -> Credits
// *[HIGH] viv_kill was refreshing the desktop window if no viv_hwnd was created.
// [HIGH] like mpc-hc, allow /add to add to the playlist (instead of clearing the playlist)
// [HIGH] like mpc-hc, allow *.jpg as the pathname.

// [HIGH] playlist pane or tool window
// /close command line option like mpc-hc -how does mpc handle /playnext /close ? -/close needs to work with /slideshow (close after slideshow)
// vs2022 support
// use the sort order from Windows Explorer, from where the images was opened. -do we need another sort option (use default) or (use Windows Explorer sort)
// shrink blit mode=nearest doesn't work.

// AVIF
// GDI/GDI+ is limited to 2GB (wide*high*4), work out a workaround for large images.
// compile on mingw
// Undo option, after delete, undo the delete and re-add the image to the playlist.

// dark mode (nothing in viv has Microsoft dark theme support -I will have to render ALL controls myself)
// Use Direct3D to render images when shrinking.
// use sort order from Windows Explorer folder.
// Copy the zoomed part of the image to another buffer and stretch that to avoid gdi driver issues when zooming in really close with large images.
// - get image width/length via IPC
// - get/set viv display area width/length via IPC
// Support piping of image data for ImageMagic support
// - set/get zoom level 
// - change zoom in/out level in 1/10/100 percent steps
// - auto zoom levels: always fit to width, always fit to height, zoom inside (fit to width or height so that still the whole image is shown), zoom outside (fit to width or height so that the window is fully filled)
// - option to keep the custom zoom level while image displayed changed
// - by holding left mouse button on displayed image and moving the mouse, move viv window when using "zoom inside" mode, else move image inside viv window
// - keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C to copy viv display area to clipboard and Ctrl+V to paste the image from clipboard and display it.
// - I use ImageMagick's convert.exe and GraphicsMagick's gm.exe tools for color correction an image sharpening. I need to pipe out the image showing in viv to those apps and pipe in the output of those apps to viv and display the processed image without writing to disk, i.e. viv write to STOUT and read from STDIN.
// - may be there could be an option in viv that the user just provide the executable names and the command line parameters that optionally would be executed whenever the file displayed changes. - some sort of multiple instances setting, eg: viv.exe -no-new-instance -other command line arguments... -could also support named instances
// - set/get file name of displayed image. Considering when clipboard/STDIN is displayed, it would be nice to still be able to get the name of the file that was displayed before showing the clipboard/STDIN.
// - auto update the image displayed when the image on disk (or the clipboard) has changed
// - next/previous image with option to show files in subfolders. Considering when clipboard/STDIN is displayed, the base image would be the file that was displayed before showing the clipboard/STDIN.
// - border less window with retractable title bar
// - dark skin (use system theme)
// - snap viv window to other windows and the monitor borders
// - no minimum viv window size restriction
// - open/edit image with another app
// - color correction, white balance, sharpening
// - == mehdi

// therube: Just to note...  Something like: voidImageViewer.exe "\my documents" or voidImageViewer.exe "\my documents\"  , will load "images" found in the \my documents\ directory.  Though somethig like: voidImageViewer.exe "\my documents\*" or voidImageViewer.exe "\my documents\*.*"  will load (I suppose it is) ALL images on your computer. voidImageViewer.exe "\my documents\*.jpg" works as expected. 
// maintain correct image aspect ratio when window is clipped on auto size.
//
// DONE:
// 1.0.0.0
// *deleting the last image in a playlist does not clear the image.
// *added xbutton action
// *dont invalidate when zooming out when we are already zoomed out the most.
// *when keep aspect ratio is off, zooming in should use the bad aspect otherwise aspect gradually changes to same aspect.
// *added ctrl mousewheel action
// *fixed an issue when only one image was in the playlist.
// *fixed a leak when loading an image.
// *fixed a crash when there was only one shuffled image.
// *improved randomize seeding
// *fixed a leak when loading an image while already loading an image.
// *rotate option -using verbs
// *added /x /y /width /height /minimal /compact command line options.
// *fixed /dc command line option
// *j - jump to list - replaces navigate menu.
// *everything search
// *added f2 rename.
// *current image is added to playlist when adding an image to the playlist and the playlist is empty.
// *fix stream for gifs, don't load the entire image before loading the gif. _viv_istream_t hurts loading performance, will leave CreateStreamOnHGlobal for now.
// *allow WM_CLOSE from admin/nonadmin. 
// *sysmenu when fullscreen -needed to show size cursors
// *fixed a bug with move to/copy to
// *fixed a bug with save as filters.
// *fix ico association. -whats wrong with ico association?
// *startmenu shortcuts
// *dont use current directory so we can delete the folder of the current shown image .
// *select background window color
// *Important features I needed while testing:
// *I encountered sometimes Errors when I did Ctrl+Z for Undo. I think the image file indeed was moved back but for some reason it says error. Anyway, I did not notice exactly when it occurs. -no undo api, can be undone from Windows Explorer
// *Win + Arrows - shouldn't navigate, but just resize the window. -no longer navigate, not sure about resizing, need a keyboard with windows keys..
// *Ctrl+C Ctrl+X = Copy/Move the current displayed image file (for copying/moving to other location in Explorer, for cases you need to do it just once)
// *Ctrl+V = Add images to ImagePool (Instead of dropping, you can do Crtl+C in Explorer and then Ctrl+V in PhotoSIft)
// *Open Location of file (Show in Explorer).
// *Clear ΓÇô This command needs a Hotkey (Maybe Crtl+W like in Word), and Dialog Box to approve. -added as close ctrl + W
// *Write the Dimensions (weight height) of each pic and the speed of animation.
// *Voidimageviewer has a nice feature of controlling the animation rate (speed), to make it fast/slower.
// *open clipboard to view image in clipboard? -no must be file based for now
// *Mousewheel up/down ΓÇô Most of image viewers use these keys for one of two actions: 1. Next image / Previous image 2. Zoom in / Zoom out -keyboard shortcut to toggle between the two.
// *print -using preview to print ..
// *play gifs atleast once.
// *separate setting for filter quality when fullscreen/windowed. -why?
// *set as desktop background
// *SetThreadExecutionState (prevent sleep) - SC_MONITORPOWER and SC_SCREENSAVE work.
// *custom slideshow rate
// *status bar to show rate changes and other information.
// *animation menu
// *portable with ini options.
// *copy to / move to menu
// *open location AND select current filename.
// *use a nice stretch when displaying the image for the first time? -always use a nice stretch.
// *alt + 1, alt + 2, alt + 3, alt + 4 window sizes
// *pressing left / right should stop slideshow? -nope
// *f11 shouldn't be a toggle.
// *when fill window is selected and then 1:1 is selected, selecting 1:1 again, should go back to fill window. 1:1 to is more of a action, and the tick is to indicate that it is currently 1:1, it should not be treated as a switch
// *animation control pause/advance frame
// *draw alpha blending images correctly (snail_test.gif)
// *mouse back forward button support
// *check current item in playlist
// *tick 1:1 in view menu when 1:1
// *COLORONCOLOR or HALFTONE mode.
// *file associations
// *multiple instances / single instance.
// *open folders (from drag drop)
// *right click -> Open file location
// *rotate? -no, this is not a photo viewer and we dont modify images.
// *file -> Properties
// *show hand when image is movable? -need custom cursor.
// *middle mouse button move.
// *gamma control -we assume monitor is set correctly and that images do not need modifying.
// *file -> print / page setup
// *really goto the next image after deleting an image.
// *use new image (IStream) instead of a file, that way we can close the file, no longer will we keep an open handle to the file.
// *nav -> list of files
// *hide cursor on fullscreen
// *why does webp use soo much RAM when gif doesn't use any? -because we used a memory bitmap instead of a compatible bitmap -images now stored in video RAM.
// *mipmaps for shrink resizing.. could generate mipmaps on load or as needed. -too slow. maybe do this on resize only. -find a way to do this efficiently
// *add right click Exit
// *Ctrl + Shift + C = Copy filename / *add an option to copy image path ctrl + shift +c
// *Copy "Image" context menu item. -users don't want to copy the file, they want the image. -they don't want to copy meta data. -we were copying the image too with copy, but we now have a separate option to copy just the image.
// 1.0.0.11
// *rotate now rotates mipmaps correctly.
// *view -> Menu setting not remembered. -added caption and thickframe too.
// *exit in right click menu
// *rate up/down was upside down
// *option to keep last viewed image in cache.
// *when going back (left arrow key), start preloading the previous item instead.
// *F5 = reload current image.
// *fixed a crash when interrupting the loading of a multi-frame image.
// *dragging the status bar should move the window.
// *fix going fullscreen and using the window zoom, if zoomed in and we go fullscreen the zoom is too much (try a small image to see)
// *opening a non existing filename should show an error message: "File Not Found". eg: viv.exe "c:\non-existing-folder\foo.jpg" -also added "failed to load image" message for bad images.
// *hide mouse on hover.
// *using wrong registry key in _viv_install_association_by_extension.
// 1.0.0.12
// *fixed a gdi leak when freeing mipmaps
// *fixed a gdi leak when refreshing.
// *fixed changing sort loading the wrong next image.
// *added natural sort
// 1.0.0.13
// *add left click action: move window
// *large images lose center on resize. -typo in (high - rw)
// *I will add an option to auto resize the window to show the full image (50%/100%/200%) when a new image is shown. -already had option -added GUI option and improve autofit
// *break the redraw region down into rects and only stretch what we need to. -SelectClipRgn works well when using halftone.
// *back/forward mouse buttons dont work on toolbars
// *does viv update correct when we drop a folder on viv and then delete an image from that folder? does undelete show the file? -removed preload check so we always load the next image from disk, in case preload is stale. -dropping a folder creates a playlist, we will not monitor folders and we already delete from the playlist when deleting from viv.
// *don't bother preloading if the next image is the last image.
// 1.0.0.14
// *break POS and RGB into separate parts
// *allow xbuttons to repeat -noone does this.
// *move window action: I will trial scrolling if zoomed, then fallback to move window.
// *orientation metadata for rotation.
// *pixel info doesn't work if shrinking. -we incorrectly get the pixel from the mipmap.
// *webp alpha using wrong background color 
// *re-enabled WEBP_MSC_SSE41 
// *-switches -don't just use /switch, allow -switch command line options.
// *fixed rotating the wrong way.
// *correct tracking of center pixel when zooming/resizing.
// *when going full screen, check if the image is currently smaller than it would be full screen, if it is, set a flag to restore the zoom, save the zoom and set the zoom to 0.
// *D:\Misc\Game Data\Aladdin\Aladdin-RugRide.png doesn't render correctly on some zooms 85129x224 -converted int to __int64
// *check the viv icon is being used for webp. -it does, but you have to open a webp file first and allow voidimageviewer to open.
// *prevent screen saver on slideshow
// 1.0.0.15
// *fixed _viv_dst_pos_x/_viv_dst_pos_y (doubled offsets to match mpchc)
// *zooming in AND numpad+6 zooming breaks for largish images. (black bars on scrolling) -pan and zoom was overflowing, set stitch size to 512 to fix.
// *In "1:1" mode, use shortcut keys to move a big picture(larger than the screen resolution), it will stop halfway. Perhaps it has something to do with the movement of the small images? -mpc does the whole image.
// 1.0.0.16
// *add UI option for config_title_bar_format. (by hesphoros)
// *option to show full path like MPC. (by hesphoros)
// *fix controls in view options page being 1 pixel too long
// *fix jump-to up/down focus
// *validate frame delay data
// *use rename collision resolution name
// *rename no to conflict should keep the rename dialog shown so user can continue with a different name.



// _VIV_STRETCH_BLT_STITCH_SIZE * 3.1 (pan+zoom) * 16 (zoom) MUST BE < 32768
